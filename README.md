# Lead Content Project Template

This repository provides a starter template for building Lead and Content agents using either Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) or OpenAI's Agents SDK. It includes basic configuration management and example tools.

The Python modules contain extensive inline comments explaining each step of the agent setup so they can be used as learning references.
